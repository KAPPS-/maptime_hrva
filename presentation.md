# Why we don't use decennial census
---
US Census 2000 used short and long forms, but Census 2010 only used the short form.
awesome variables like income are now collected using the American Community Survey (ACS) instead
---
# ACS

* 1 year ( most current, small sample size, only biggest communities )
* 3 year 
* 5 year ( least current, huge sample size, all areas )

[Which](http://www.census.gov/acs/www/guidance_for_data_users/estimates/) do I choose?
